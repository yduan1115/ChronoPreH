Hi, so here is the description of this R package. 

Basically, it is used for the prediction of large datasets, including mostly medical datasets, for the usage of disease prediction. It can also be used for astronomical datasets. Maybe also more, but I am just familiar with these two fields. Happy to communicate if you want to apply it in your discipline! : )
